# Rubik Cube Simulation

Rubik cube is 3D pazzel invented by professor of architecture Erno Rubik in 1974. It has approximately 43 quintillion different arrangments (status). To put this into perspective, if one had one standard-sized Rubik's Cube for each status, one could cover the Earth's surface 275 times, or stack them in a tower 261 light-years high.



The standard rubik cube has 6 faces, on each face has 9 fixed colors. The standard moves are R(turning clokewise) and R'(turn-counterclockwise) These two moves can be apploied to each face which generate different moves which are called R(right), R'(reverse-right), L(left),L'(reverse-left), U, U', B, B' and so on...



 Two computer program developed in R to simulate the Rubik cube with 3*3 and N*N.
 
 Two Rubik cube computer models developed for 3 * 3 and N * N cubes.
